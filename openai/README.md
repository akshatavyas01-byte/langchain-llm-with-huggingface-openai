OpenAi LangChain Projects
-------------------------------

This folder contains Python programs built with LangChain that connect to the OpenAI API. Each example demonstrates how to use hosted OpenAi models for natural language tasks ‚Äî such as grammer corrector and jobDiscription to json.

1.Grammar Corrector (OpenAI)

  -Uses ChatOpenAI wrapper from langchain_openai.

  -Uses ChatPromptTemplate to design conversational grammar correction prompts.
  
  -Uses dotenv to load the OpenAI API key directly from the .env file.

  -Uses LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) or the pipe (|) symbol.

  -[This directly connects the prompt with the model in a single step.]

  -Uses the model gpt-4o-mini.

  -Acts as a grammar instructor that corrects grammatical errors in sentences.

  -Returns the corrected version of the input sentence.

  -Interactive ‚Äî user can input any sentence for correction.

  -Accurate and fluent grammatical correction output.


2.Job Description Structurer (OpenAI)

  -Uses ChatOpenAI wrapper from langchain_openai.
  
  -Uses ChatPromptTemplate for structured prompt design.

  -Uses JsonOutputParser to generate clean JSON output.

  -Uses dotenv to load the OpenAI API key directly from the .env file.

  -Uses LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) or the pipe (|) symbol.

  -[This connects the prompt ‚Üí model ‚Üí output parser seamlessly in one line.]

  -Uses the model gpt-4o-mini.

  -Takes unstructured job descriptions and converts them into a structured JSON object.

  -Iterative ‚Äî user can generate multiple structured outputs interactively.

  -Accurate and clean JSON output without empty fields.
